## Motivation

Tired of eating the same food everyday from the same faculty? Don’t know where to go to burn the midnight oil? Unsure of where to find food to fill your stomach at 2am?
With NUSWhere, we have compiled a handy guide to food, study and navigation in NUS all in one convenient app. 
You will be spoiled for choice at the vast number of study and food places available and won’t have to fear getting lost again.

## Aim

We aim to make navigating around NUS easy by providing bus routes, food and study options.

## Core Features

1. Food places in NUS sorted by 5 main categories.
   - Users will be able to save their favourite food places by clicking the heart button 
   - Search bar that filters the food places by detailed tags (e.g “Bubble Tea”, “Japanese”, etc)
2. Study areas in NUS sorted by faculty and libraries
   - Multiple photos provided per study spot
3. Bus navigation
   - Directions from one location to another via NUS shuttle buses
   - Includes locations away from bus stops (e.g “E2”, “LT19”, “Music Library”)
   - Results will show approx. time taken to travel. 
4. Google Maps View
   - Real-time Location
   - Search for lesson venues (taken from NUSMods) that will be projected onto map (e.g “LT26”, “BIZ1-0202", "CEREBRO")
